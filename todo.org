#+title: Todo
* TODO
- [X] Make a ASCII data field with a length that can be set in the config
- [X] allow an offset in the chunk to be made
- [X] allow the possibility to have integers of arbitrary length, positive and negative
- [X] refactor using library
- [X] write tests
- [X] use separate threads for input and output
- [X] print raw data chunk in hex at top of output (as option)
- [X] remove debugging thread wait in main
- [X] proper error handling (instead of unwrapping everything)
- [ ] add possibility to display LSB0 (least significant BIT first) and MSB0 formatted data (and default to whatever is more common) -> MSB0 is more common
- [X] add possibility to display Little Endian and Big Endian (BYTES!) formatted data -> Big Endian (Network Bytes order) is more common for mviews use case. (use functions load_le and load_be for this)
  for some reason it does not make a differnce if I call load_be oder load_le, I have to do further research on this
- [ ] write some config syntax checker and information why config is wrong
- [X] don't care if its bool, Bool, BOOL or even bOoL
- [X] add option to display timestamp of the last printed chunk
- [X] add option to display statistics (number of chunks, number of bytes received)
- [X] add option to display numbers in hex, bin
  use :b, :binary (for binary) or :h, :hex or :hexadecimal (for hex) as suffix of the line of an integer in config
- [X] write readme
- [X] add info about chunk start and end in statistics
- [X] make graphics in readme over several messages
- [X] add option to write to stdout like writing to outfile
- [ ] test output for mix of config lines
- [ ] test formatting function
- [ ] test print_stats, print_raw_bin etc. functions
- [X] at least for the gaaps and integer function also assert in tests that the right bitpos is returned
